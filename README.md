# Rocket-1D

This was one of the projects I made over the first Covid lockdown, when I was 16. I made it using Pygame and assets I created myself using microsoft paint. It is exclusively coded in python.

This project pits neural net driven rockets to land on a platform underneath them. Mechanics are implemented using SUVAT arithmetic. Rockets can run out of fuel and if they hit the ground too hard then they will be destroyed. Following generation is cloned from the best performer from the previous generation. Performance is assessed by the agents speed when they make contact with the ground.
